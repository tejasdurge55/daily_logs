Due to an accidental data mix-up, user data was unintentionally mingled on Nautilus App Server 2 at the /home/usersdata location by the Nautilus production support team in Stratos DC. To rectify this, specific user data needs to be filtered and relocated. Here are the details:

Locate all files (excluding directories) owned by user siva within the /home/usersdata directory on App Server 2. Copy these files while preserving the directory structure to the /blog directory.

```
find /home/usersdata -type f -user siva -exec cp --parents {} /blog \;

```
