# HELLO EVERYONE
# 27th Oct 2022
Currently the diwali festival is going on.I am currently enjoying my diwali holidays.
Along with the enjoyment i have started my journey towards the basics of DevOps.
Today, I ran my first docker image,it contained an nginx webpage also learnt the basics of Docker.
Also revised and learnt some of the basic Linux commands.
Today as well as yesterday i wasted a lot of time for installing docker and linux.
After installation at the time of rebooting,my laptop was giving the "KMOD exeption not handled" error.
After a lot of tries i gave up on it.Insted i started using the VM's of "Killercoda" platform.
It already had linux,docker and kubernetes packages which i could use for free.
Just the session has a time limit of 1 hour,but i could start a lot of free sessions as much i wanted.
I also started a new twitter account.Actually i have 0 knowledge about twitter,but let's start today.
I have started to write these daily logs so that i can constantly keep on practicing git and github.
I had previously made a commit on github a month ago.Today i have forgotten even how to do that :(
So,i have decided to update my daily logs and DSA java practice codes everyday to track my progress.
I hope that i may stay consistent and hardworking towards my future journey.
